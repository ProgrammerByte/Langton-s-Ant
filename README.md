# Langton-s-Ant
Langton's Ant in Java. This project was built using my path finding editor as a template, therefore there is some shared code / functionality between these two projects.

Controls:
While in edit mode:
Left Click - Places a white tile
Right Click - Places a black tile

Can be used at any time:
Enter - Start / pause Langton's Ant
Q - Toggle grid
ESC - Exit
